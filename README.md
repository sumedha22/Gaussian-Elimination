# Gaussian-Elimination

Gaussian Elimination without pivoting using Pthreads and MPI

Gaussian Elimination

Goal: To transform a system of linear equations into an upper-triangular matrix in order to solve the unknowns and derive a solution. A multiplier is used to make the entries below the diagonal element as zero and then back-substitution is applied to derive the solution.
